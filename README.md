###Bringing wordpress like filters and actions to Codeigniter
by [Yvo van Dillen](http://www.atomicon.nl)

Wordpress has a fantastic action and filtering system.
So I decided to bring this functionality to Codeigniter.

##Installation
Just copy the files from this package to the correspoding folder in your
application folder.

##Usage
In the package you will find example usage code in the controllers and views
folders.

Have fun,
